# .NetCore 3 micro service with CleanArchitecture,CQRS, DDD 
### This is a template for an application structured by CleanArchitecture 
**(Produce by Uncle Bob Martin)**

Also, this work with the **Domain Driven Design** pattern, where all application parts splitted to domains as Documents domain, Processes Domain and etc.

In this service i used the **Fluent Validation** and **MediatR** libraries, that helps to emphesize the power of an microservice written in .netcore.

Also i used the **CQRS** pattern, which devides the actions in the rest service to:

*Queries*: get, fetch, search.

*Commans*: set, update, put, delete, create.
